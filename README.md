# Horn-s-Method-Slope-Calculation-using-DEM
C++ implementation of Horn’s method for calculating terrain slope using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The algorithm applies a 3×3 convolution kernel to compute the partial derivatives (dz/dx and dz/dy) from the elevation grid and then derives the slope in degrees.
